<p>This is used to set up shops for your quest. When you click on Shop Types, a menu comes up with 15 numbers, Edit, and Cancel. To create a new shop type, click on a number you haven't used yet and Edit. This brings up a Shop Data dialog box with spaces for three items. Choose an item from the drop-down menu and enter the price for it above that item. You can have a shop with just one item by using only the first item listed, or 2 items by using only the first 2, but don't leave one blank and enter something in the next one. </p>
<h3>Info types</h3>
<p>This is for caves where the guy sells information. It works just like Shop Data, set the prices and choose the message strings from the drop-down menu. To create new strings go to Quest->Strings first. </p>
<h3>Warp rings</h3>
<p>The Warp Rings are the rooms with 3 staircases that warp you to different parts of your quest. Uses Overworld Room 81. </p>
<p>When you click on Warp Rings, a dialog box will pop up with the numbers 0-7. To create a warp ring, click on a number you haven't used yet and Edit. </p>
<p>This brings up the dialog box for that particular warp ring. Count (3-8) is where you enter how many locations you want for that warp ring. You then edit each site number, entering the Dmap and screen number you want to warp to for each one. Then click OK, or (to test the warp) Go will take you to the screen you just entered. </p>
<p>To use, make a room of type 3-Stair warp and set the ring by pressing A.</p>
<h3>Whistle warps</h3>
<p>These are for setting the warps that the whistle takes the player to. Whistle warps become active when you have collected triforce pieces.

Click on the first black square to choose the tile for Link with no rings, the 2nd for Link with the blue ring, the 3rd for Link with the red ring, and 4th for Link with the gold ring. In most cases this is the same tile. The colors will be determined by Extra Sprite Palette 1 Csets 9-12. </p>
<h3>Misc. Colors</h3>
<p> The numbers left of the rectangle are Csets of the main palette, the numbers above are the colors in each Csets.. The numbers listed in each item below are 1st digit=Cset and 2nd digit=color in that Cset You can click on one of the color edit boxes, then click on a color in the color table, and it will set that color automatically (no need to find the row and column yourself).</p>
<h3>Map Styles</h3>
<p> Used for customizing default-subscreen overworld and dungeon maps(5X3), frame(2X2), triforce pieces to go in frame (1X1), heart container pieces (1X1, enter the first of the set of 5 tiles: empty, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and full), and triforce frame(6X3).

<h3>Header</h3>
<p>The Header dialog lets you set some information that the player will see/need before they start your quest.</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Quest Number</td><td> Custom Quests should use number 0. Other numbers are reserved for built-in quests. Always set this to 0.
<tr><td>Quest Version</td><td> It's a string. 
<tr><td>Minimum Version</td><td> If a player's saved game was from a version less than the minimum version (using a strcmp) they have to restart from the beginning. This is useful if you make major changes to your quest. 
<tr><td>Title and Author</td><td> You get about 60 characters for each.
<tr><td>Change Password</td><td> Use a password to protect your quest. If the quest has a password, it can't be loaded in ZQuest without entering the password.  
</table>
<p>Note on passwords: The system used before 2.11 can be, and has been cracked. Don't use your personal password or your forum password for quests. In 2.11 a new hashing system is used. I still recommend you don't use your forum password here.</p>
<p>The developers reserve the right to view all quest info, including your password (pre-2.11). Phantom Menace says: "I won't abuse this power, but you should know that I have access to your quest even if you use a password."</p>
<p>Save Key File check box: Tick this and when you save the quest, a .key file is created with the same name as the quest file. This file contains the password for the quest (along with some other information). The password is in plain text format! If the .key file is present, and has the correct password (which it always should unless you edit it manually or change the password for the quest elsewhere and bring it over to that computer), then the quest will open in ZQuest without asking you for a password. This way, you don't have to remember to password your quest before sending it out (if you chose that method) and you don't have to worry about remembering the password if you like to keep it passworded all the time. Remember, if the .key file is not present, or doesn't have the right password, ZQuest will ask you for the password. The keyfile also activates the level 4 cheat when your quest is played in ZC.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>These are the basic settings that apply to your whole quest. Quest rules can be overridden on individual screens by screen flags. See the rules section.</p>
<h3>Cheats</h3>
<p>There are four levels of cheats, each with a separate code (a 40 character string) that enables them. You can disable cheats altogether, or disable certain ones by leaving the code empty (be sure there are no spaces). It's helpful to use the cheats when designing a quest. You can also choose to give out the cheat codes. It's up to you. </p>
<table>
<tr><td>Level 1</td><td> refill life, bombs, magic, and rupees any time you want. 
<tr><td>Level 2</td><td> lets you to set your number of heart containers, your maximum bombs, and make give Link a perpetual clock (enemies are frozen).

<p>To set a secret combo, click on the proper square to bring up the Combo Table, then click on the tile you want for the secret combo and press Enter.</p>
<h3>Layers</h3>
<p>You can set up to 6 layers for each screen, that way you can stack combos over each other and over Link. In the layer dialog, enter the map and screen number where you put the tiles for each layer for the current screen. Layers 1 and 2 appear under Link, 3 and 4 are over Link but below flying enemies, 5 and 6 are above flyers. To prepare a screen for any layer except 0, first fill it with the walkable transparent (black) tile so that the layers below will show through. </p>
<p>Note: Anything in layer 0 with a push flag on it appears on top of layers 1 and 2.  Link is walking on layers 1 and 2, so he can't very well push something below those layers.  This allows you to push a pushblock over different combos without changing them all to the same thing (it is actually still doing this, but set up the real floor on layer 1, then the block won't be erasing it, just layer 0, which is covered up by layer 1). </p>
<p>Transparent makes that layer translucent (see-through). </p>
<p>The auto buttons set up a layer for a whole map. Enter a map number in the dialog that pops up - basically, every screen on that map will be set up as the selected layer screen for every screen on the current map that doesn't already have a layer map set.</p>
<h3>Palette (F4)</h3>

<h3>About</h3>
<p> Brings up a Box with the version number, etc. </p>

<table>
<tr><td>Mouse scroll</td><td> Allows you to use the mouse to scroll through the combos on the right. 
<tr><td>Save paths</td><td> Makes ZQuest remember what directory you were in when you loaded a quest, saved it, grabbed tiles, imported/exported stuff, etc. 
<tr><td>Palette cycle</td><td> Allows you to see palette cycling effects in ZQ. 
<tr><td>Vsync</td><td> Makes it so that it waits for the monitor to stop drawing before doing graphics work. This can help eliminate flicker. 
<tr><td>Show FPS</td><td> Tells you how many frames there are per second. 
<tr><td>Combo Brush</td><td> Makes the cursor the current combo being used. 
<tr><td>Float Brush</td><td> In combination with the combo brush, makes the cursor the current combo casting a shadow where it will be placed. 
<tr><td>Reload Last</td><td> With this box checked ZQuest will automatically open the last quest you worked on when you start it. 
<tr><td>Show Misaligns</td><td> This option helps you avoid having a walkable combo on one screen lead into an unwalkable combo on the next screen.
