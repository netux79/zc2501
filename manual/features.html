<h2 id="maps">Maps</h2>
<p>A map is a 6x8 collection of screens. The limit is 255 maps to a quest, but you can have more than one Dmap per map. At any time in the game Link is both on a map and a dmap. The map/screen contains the actual combos, the dmap the palette/music and other information.</p>
<p>The last four screens in a map have specific uses:
<list>
<li /> 0x80:  Default cave or item room (where you put special items and overworld guys) 
<li /> 0x81:  3-stair warp cave in the overworld, passageway in dungeons 
<li /> 0x82:  Reserved 
<li /> 0x83:  Screen template (see template section), used mainly in dungeons  
</list>
</p>
<p>
<i>Warning: Do not use theese screens as normal screens in your game.</i> <br />
Any warp of type "Cave/Item room" will take you to screen 80 on the current map, and when you leave it back to the screen you came from. 
</p>
<h2 id="graphics">Graphics: Palettes, Csets</h2>
<p>The ZC palette is divided up into 15 blocks of 16 colors each. These blocks are called "Csets" (color sets). The first color in each Cset is transparent. <br />
Csets 0-5 are background colors and 6-14 are sprite colors. Below is an explanation of each: </p>

<p>
<b>Background colors: </b>
<list>
<li />	0,1: used for subscreen colors and map colors 
<li />	2-4: loaded with different "level colors" * 
<li />	5: extra bkg CSet, independent of level
</list>
Additionally Csets 6-11 can now be used as background Csets in the main editor.</p>

<p>
<b>Sprite colors: </b>
<list>
<li />	6: Link's colors 
<li />	7-8: constant sprite colors 
<li />	9: level-defined sprite colors * 
<li />	10-13: extra constant sprite color Csets 
<li />	14: used for boss colors, which are loaded as needed
</list>
* Tiles using CSet 9 will change color according to the level the player is in. </p>

<p>
<b>Levels</b>
<list>
<li />	00: Overworld Dmap Csets that change according to level 
<li />	01-09: Palettes for Levels 1-9 Dmaps 
<li />	0A: Palettes for cave Dmaps 
<li />	0B: Palettes for passageways and item rooms in dungeons. 
<li />	0C-FF: Extra level Dmap palettes 
</list>
Note: The white numbers on the left in the level palette editor are the regular colors for the dungeon Csets. <br />
The black numbers show what that Csets turns to when the room is dark. <br />
The 2 shades of grey numbers are the in-between colors that Csets go through when fading from light to dark or vice versa. </p>

<p>
<b>Sprite Palettes - Extra Sprite Palette 1: </b>
<list>
<li />	0: Aquamentus Cset 
<li />	1: Gleeok Cset 
<li />	2: Digdogger and its kids Cset 
<li />	3: Ganon Cset 
<li />	4: Ganon stunned Cset

<b>Extra Sprite Palette 2:</b> If you need extra sprite c-sets in making custom quests, load them here.
</p> 
<h4 id="paletteeditor">The Palette Edit Dialog </h4>
<img src="man_pics/palettes.gif" />
<p>This dialog is under Quest-Graphics-Palettes.</p>
<p>You can copy an entire Cset over to a different Cset: highlight the Cset you wish to copy and press 'C', then highlight the any other Cset and press 'V'. Presto, you have copied the Cset. This can save a lot of time if you want to copy animated palettes, like the water and fire in dungeons, over to different levels. </p>
<p>When editing a palette, you can copy a single color to one of the other 16 colors in the palette. When editing a palette's colors, you can use the numeric keys  : </p>
<list>
<li />1, 2, 3, to move RGB values down (respectively)
<li />7, 8, 9 to move RGB values up (respectively)
<li />4 to move the cursor left
<li />6 to move it right. 
</list>
<p>This is easier than adjusting with the cross on the color spectrum and Inserting. In the level palettes there is a name field where you can name the palette for easy identification. The U in palette editor is Undo.</p>

<h2 id="combos">Combos</h2>
<p>
Combos are the building blocks of maps. Combos are a tile with extra game info, such as a type that can be water, stairs, cave, etc. , walk flags that can be set for each 8x8 corner, inherent flags, and animation. The tile can be flipped horizontally and/or vertically. What you place on your screens are combos (and not just tiles).</p>

<p>The combo viewer/editor is under Quest/Graphics/combos. Hot keys are: 
<list>
<li />Enter: select current combo and close
<li />ESC: close
<li />space: toggle horizontal and vertical views 
<li />Numpad +,-: change CSet 
<li />Ctrl + Numpad +,-: change tile of selected combos by +/- 1.
<li />Arrows: move selection
<li />Shift + Arrows: Select a range.
<li />P : go to page
<li />E: edit current combo 
<li />C: copy (select) a combo.
<li />O: overwrite the destination combo with the source combo.
<li />S: swap source and destination combos.
<li />H , V (when no combos copied) : horizontally or vertically flip the tile of this combo
<li />M : move combos (when copied). Moves the source here and deletes the source combos, removing their places in the combo table.
<li />V (when combos copied) : paste. This will copy the source combos to the destination.  
<li />Shift - V : mass paste. Select a range and press to fill the whole range with the source combos, repeating them if necesary.
<li />Ctrl - V : advanced paste. Brings up a dialog where you can select which properties of the combo you want to copy. note that you can only advance paste from one source combo and that mass paste applies automatically.
<li />PgUp, PgDown: changes the combo page
<li />Del: delete a combo, leaving an empty space in the combo page.
<li />I : insert an empty combo before the current combo, moving all following combos one to the right.
<li />Shift - I : delete the current combo and move all following ones one space to the left. Unlike Del this does not leave an empty space.
<li />U : undo last action
</list>

Note: To copy and paste a whole combo page (or part of one), click on the first combo, hold shift and click on the last combo. Press C. Go to the combo page you want to copy to. Click on the first space and hit C. This method can also be used to delete a number of combos by pressing delete after selecting the combos. </p>

<h4>The Combo Edit Dialog:</h4>
<img src="man_pics/editcombo.gif" />

<p>This can be brough up by pressing E in the combo pages, or right-clicking a combo in the combo page or the combo panel on the main screen.</p>
<p>
<list>
<li /> Click on the tile (first square) to edit the tile and/or flip status. 
<li /> The square next to the tile shows the places you can't walk. Click corners to toggle grey for walkable and red for unwalkable. 
<li /> The second square is used if you want to use more than one Cset on the tile. Click the corners to toggle grey (regular Cset) and blue (2nd Cset). 
<li /> Enter the difference between the Cset and the number of the 2nd Cset on the CSet 2 line. With this, you can also make combos that use Cset 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 by making the entire square blue.
<li /> Next: This square is used to show what combo will be next for combo cycling.
<li /> A. Frames: Number of frames for animated combo. 
<li /> A. Speed: Speed of animation. 
<li /> A. Skip X and Y : how many tiles the combo skips each time it advances to the next frame.
<li /> Type: See list below.
<li /> Flag: Inherent flags. A combo can have both an inherent and a normal flag, see the flags section for a list of types.
<li /> Refresh anim. : Restarts animation on the first tile whenever you enter the room.
</list>

<li /> Click the tile to select a new one.
<li /> Check the Flash box if you want the item to "flash" a different Cset, then enter that Cset # under flash Cset.
<li /> 2-Hand box: When checked, Link uses both hands to pick up the item. Recommended for large items such as raft and ladder. 
<li /> For animated items, enter the number of animation frames and the animation speed on the proper lines. In this case the tiles for the animation should be in the order you want them to show from left to right in the tileset, and the item in the box should be the first tile in that sequence. 
<li /> Initial. Delay: The delay before rerunning the animation sequence. The Number entered is a multiple (2=2x, etc.). 
<li /> Link tile mod. : Changes Link's appearance when he has this item. All Link tiles are changed to the one this many tiles after the current one. A bit of maths is needed to get these set up properly.

<li /> These are the item's properties that control what slot this item uses on the subscreen and more.
<list>
<li />Class Number: Each item class (swords, boomerangs, bows ...) has a class number.
Giving an item a class no. of an item slot on the subscreen makes it appear there.
<li />Class Level: The level of this item in its class, for instance wooden sword=1, white sword=2 ...
### insert list
</list>
<li /> Counters: Some items (keys) you can have several of, these items use one of 32 counters. To make such items set:
<list>
<li /> Increase Amount: If set, picking up one of this item adds that many to the number of this counter.
<li /> Counter reference: which counter is increased, -1 = none. 
<li /> DCounter: Set this for counters 1 and 4, for others leave it unchecked.
<li /> Currently implemented counters:
0 - life, 1 - rupees, 2 - bombs, 3 - arrows, 4 - magic, 5 - keys, and 6 - super bombs,
</list>
<li /> Full Max: The absolute maximum that the item can increase the maximum of the counter to. For example, a heart container will have a value of 256, which is 16 hearts (one heart is 16 HP), which means that a heart container cannot increase the heart count to above 16.
<li /> +Max: The amount to increase the maximum counter by. For a heart container, this is 16, representing one heart. Note that the increase amount for a heart container is also 16. Yes, you can increase the active counter AND the maximum counter at the same time.
<li /> Keep Item when Collected: specifies whether you keep an item in your inventory when collected. For example, a sword and a shield would have this checked. A rupee and a heart would not.
</list>
</p>
