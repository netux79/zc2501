<h1 id="itemedit">The Item Editor</h1>

<p>The item editor is under Quest/Items. Here you can edit the properties of game items and create new ones. To edit an item, select it in the list and press edit. To create a new one, select an unused slot (z###, at the end of the list) and press edit. You can not give names to your custom items yet. You place items on a screen by pressing I and selecting them from the list.</p>
