<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>
<i>The first thing you should know is that Zelda Classic does have its limitations. It started out as a clone of Zelda 1, which is also very limited. Although it has grown and will continue to grow, it can't do everything you might have in mind. </i></p>

<p><i>That said, you'll find that there is a lot that can be done within ZC's limitations. It allows for multiple overworlds, huge dungeons, and caves and dungeons that aren't "levels". It also allows you to customize the graphics, colors, MIDIs, and more. Some features are still in development.</i></p>
<p>
The above was written by Phantom Menace referring to the 1.84 version. It still holds true, though its limitations are fewer with each new version. It is now possible to make quests that bear very little resemblance to Zelda 1. </p>
<p>This is not a tutorial...there are already excellent illustrated tutorials. This is merely an attempt to complete the ZQ manual originally written by Phantom Menace.</p>
<p>
Such was the introduction to zquest.txt that came with ZC. As 2.11 nears its final form it's about time it had an official manual, and so I'm getting that done.  - <i>Koopa</i>
